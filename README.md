## Code of Conduct

For the code of conduct we chose to use the Contributor Covenant v2.0
We chose this CoC because it is a very well written and widely used
one that covers all of the bases we were looking for. It allows for 
contribution from anybody and everybody who wants to contribute, as 
well as clearly outlining what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. 
It also includes clear guidelines for reporting violations of the CoC 
and how enforcement of the CoC will be taken care of. Finally, it also 
has access to translations into other languages, making it that much
more inclusive.
