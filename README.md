## Code of Conduct

For the code of conduct we chose to use the Contributor Covenant v2.0
We chose this CoC because it is a very well written and widely used
one that covers all of the bases we were looking for. It allows for 
contribution from anybody and everybody who wants to contribute, as 
well as clearly outlining what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. 
It also includes clear guidelines for reporting violations of the CoC 
and how enforcement of the CoC will be taken care of. Finally, it also 
has access to translations into other languages, making it that much
more inclusive.

=======
## License

We chose to use the Apache License for our project. We chose this
license because it is a well known, well revised license featured
by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and one we discussed in lab. 
We also believe that this license
will allow for people to easily contribute or edit our code, which 
is something that we want. 

## Suggestions
